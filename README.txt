#  The Timetable project.

##Overview.
This project showcases my weekly class timetable in a visually simple layout. It includes an HTML file and a CSS stylesheet for styling and a screenshot of the timetable.

## Accesibility Considerations.
The image has a descriptive 'alt' attribute for screen readers.
The color contrast between text andbackground meets the accesibility standards.
